                        <strong>Hardware Inventory System</strong>
                        <br>
                        During my tenure at Bealls Inc., I spearheaded the development of a robust Hardware Inventory
                        System. The primary objective was to streamline hardware tracking across the entire
                        organization, optimizing inventory management and operational efficiency.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Key Components of the Project:</strong>
                        <br>
                        <em>Database Infrastructure:</em> I designed and implemented a Microsoft SQL Server database to
                        store essential hardware information. This centralized repository allowed seamless data
                        retrieval and updates. The database schema accommodated details such as hardware specifications,
                        serial numbers, locations, and maintenance history.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <em>Web Application and API:</em> Leveraging C# and Blazor within Visual Studio, I crafted a web
                        application that served as the user interface for managing hardware assets. The API layer
                        facilitated communication between the frontend and the database, ensuring smooth data flow.
                        Rigorous testing using Swagger validated the system’s functionality and reliability.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <em>Frontend Experience:</em> To enhance user productivity, I employed Radzen to style the
                        frontend. The visual interface provided intuitive access to hardware data. There were different
                        security levels for diefferent users meaning access to certain functions were limited. Users
                        could view inventory details, track hardware movements, and initiate many data requests
                        effortlessly even having the ability to export as spreadsheet or csv.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <em>Greenlight for Q&A Testing:</em> As I transitioned from Bealls, the project received
                        approval for quality assurance (Q&A) testing.

                        <strong>Technical Details:</strong>
                        <br>
                        <em>Frontend:</em>The app's frontend utilizes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to present movie
                        information to users. I did not work on the frontend on this project however I assisted my group
                        members when required.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <em>Backend:</em> Java is used to connect to the Movie Database API, while a Google Firebase
                        cloud database stores movie details. User interactions are also stored for future data
                        persistence. This is the section I was responsible for as I had previous experience with api's
                        and databases.

                        <br>
                        <em>User Authentication:</em> User interactions are tied to their login accounts, implemented
                        using Google Firebase Authentication. I assisted with user aithentication as I had done similiar
                        work in C#.

                        <strong>Spades</strong>
                        <br>
                        This is one of my first Java projects. It's a Spades game designed for 4 players on a single
                        screen. The game was built using javax.swing for the user interface.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <strong>Key Components of the Project:</strong>
                        <br>
                        <em>Frontend:</em> The game's frontend utilizes javax.swing to present the game board and cards
                        to players.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <em>Backend:</em> Java is used to implement the game logic, handle player actions, and manage
                        the game state.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <em>Gameplay:</em> The game follows the traditional rules of Spades, with each player playing a
                        card in turn and the highest card winning the trick.

                        <strong><a href=“https://malcolmauto.pythonanywhere.com/”>Spotify Stats</a></strong>
                        <br> I am developing a Python web application that interacts with the Spotify API to display
                        information about the user’s playlists and recently played tracks. The primary objective was to
                        provide users data about their spotify that spotify or any similiar apps did not provide. 
                        <br> 
                        <br> 
                        <strong>Key Components of the Project:</strong> 
                        <br>
                        <em>Spotify API Integration:</em> I integrated the Spotify API to fetch data about the user’s
                        playlists and recently played tracks. This allows users to view their music data in a
                        user-friendly interface. 
                        <br> 
                        <br>
                        <em>Genre Analysis:</em> I implemented a feature that analyzes the
                        genres of the user’s recently played tracks and displays the genre distribution in a pie chart.
                        This provides users with insights into their listening habits. 
                        <br> 
                        <br>
                        <em>User Authentication:</em> I used Spotify’s OAuth for user authentication. Users can log in
                        securely using their Spotify account, ensuring that their data is protected. 
                        <br> 
                        <br>
                        <em>Web Application Framework (Flask):</em> The project was developed using Flask as the web
                        application framework. Flask’s flexibility and simplicity made it an ideal choice for this
                        project. 
                        <br> 
                        <br>
                        <em>Web Application Server (Gunicorn) & Web Server (Nginx):</em> I used Gunicorn
                        as the web application server and deployed the Flask application using Nginx. This combination
                        ensured efficient handling of requests and robust performance.
